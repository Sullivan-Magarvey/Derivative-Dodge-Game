# Derivative-Dodge-Game
 I present to you Derivative Dodge, a fast reaction speed game where your only objective is to stay alive. Weaving through deadly arrows at high velocities, your character is Euler’s constant trying your best not to die, or as we like to call it, trying your best not to derive. You’re no longer trying to solve equations; you’re running from them.
